We're creating a free Front End Development Certificate.

Here are the challenges that will make up our Basic Front End Development Certificate Program:

- HTML5 and CSS

- Zipline: Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage
- Zipline: Build a Random Quote Machine
- Zipline: Show the Local Weather

This won't be a new curriculum - it will just be the first 200 hours of our full stack JavaScript curriculum.

All campers who have already completed these challenges are retroactively be eligible for the certificate.
