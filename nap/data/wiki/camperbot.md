Fork it and have fun!

## Roadmap
We're looking for ideas for new features to add, and some people to help working on the bot.
Have a look at Tickets with [help wanted](https://github.com/dcsan/gitterbot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) on the repo and maybe you can contribute?

In future, we're planning:
- Bonfire step-by-step tutorials will be available via chat and from the camperbot
- realtime tagging and searching of chats by topic
- a scripting language and natural language processing
Get involved and let us know what you'd like to see next!

## Developer chatroom
- https://gitter.im/dcsan/gitterbot
Join us on the repo chatroom to discuss new features. Perhaps we can pair up to work on the bot 2.0!

- https://gitter.im/camperbot/testing
For messing around with the bot and trying commands out, proofreading your edits to wiki content etc.
